Abstract: There is nothing more satisfying than making a change and seeing that change propagated through somewhere immediately. Lately, I have been experimenting a lot with integrating D3 charts into Vue. I tried doing this with helpers, directives and, most recently, with components. Since Vue is declaring components to be their recommended implementation method for reusable components I am going to be focusing here on that version.
