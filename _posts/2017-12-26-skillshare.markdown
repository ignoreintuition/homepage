HTML5 is a constantly evolving standard for how we program and design for the web.  In this class we will be looking at some of the well established and widely supported APIs introduced in this spec that are applicable to web developers.  This includes WebSockets for connectivity, client side storage and IndexedDB for storing data in the clientâ€™s browser, graphical programming using the Canvas API,  Performance and Progressive Enhancement using Web Workers, and AJAX using XMLHttpRequest.  

We will be combining these into a small progressive web app.  This class is an intermediate JavaScript course and expects that you have an understanding of core JavaScript concepts or some functional programming language as well as a basic understanding of the way things work on the web.
