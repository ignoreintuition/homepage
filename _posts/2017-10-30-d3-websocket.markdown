We use data coming in from a streaming data source to give constant feedback to our customers. This becoming a more critical point as we look to provide our users with constant feedback on the status of their automobiles, their devices, and any other product that is wirelessly connected to their home. Just as important as providing access to this data is doing do with a design that clearly demonstrates what the value is of the data. You can provide access to the raw data which, depending on the user, may or may not be valuable. Most likely what you are going to want to do is present the data in a visual context. Your data should be shown in a way that: - Clearly indicates if there is a problem that needs to be addressed - Is unambiguous. The presentation of the data shouldn’t mislead the user - Is more than just decoration. It should be providing the user with some actionable information (even if that action is “All Systems Operational”) What are you going to walk away with: - An understanding of how to attach to data from a streaming data source via web sockets - Create aggregations of this data using D3 and JavaScript array prototype functions - Bind data dynamically to a data visualization
